  The threads implementation was significantly faster than the process implementation.
  It could be attributed to the memory locality aspect. For threads implementation, the memory
  shared between threads are local within the same process while the process implementation 
  uses inter-process-communication buffers to share memory between the parent consumer and child
  producers.
